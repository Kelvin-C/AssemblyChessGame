Oscilloscope Chess - Assembly Language

———————————————————————————————————————

A chess game can be played with a keypad, 2 DAC circuits, an oscilloscope and an ATmega128 processor.
The game was completely coded in assembly language, hence the code is long for its purpose.
The only rules implemented were castling and the general movement of each piece. En passant, promotion, check and checkmate were not implemented.
